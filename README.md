# Unemployment_Analysis

## Overview

#### I used the Economic Research FRED API to collect data about unemployment rates by state and by year. I then visualized the unemployment rates in the United States from the years 2020 to 2022 to be able to better understand which states were more impacted by Covid-19 and how they bounced back.
